# Revenue Share Inventory

In 2020, Virginia passed legislation to offers localities two options to generate revenues from utility-scale solar and energy storage systems. As described in the Code of Virginia section 58.1-3660, the default option is to levy a Machinery and Tools (M&T)/Real Estate tax on capital investments in solar generation facilities. Alternatively, a locality may adopt an ordinance to replace the M&T/Real Estate tax with a Revenue Share arrangement. Under the Revenue Share model, localities receive income from solar facilities at a flat rate in dollars of up to $1,400 per megawatt of generation capacity per year.

2. __css__ - Stylesheet used by index.html to design HTML elements including font size, position, and color. 
3. __.gitignore__ - File that tells Git to intentional ignore files that in this case contain sensitive information such as login credentials which should not be pushed to the repository.
4. __main.js__ - A JavaScript file used by index.html to add interactivity, such as toggles, checkboxes, and dynamic coloring of elements.
